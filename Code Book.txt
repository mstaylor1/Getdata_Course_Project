CODE BOOK for "Run_analysis.R" 

The raw data for the "tidy data set" was obtained at this link

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Summary statistics presented in the "features.txt" file at the above link were processed as follows:

Only the mean and standard deviation statistics were processed.  All summary statistics were themselves averaged across unique activity-subject combinations.  Note that no effort to reproduce the data from the raw inertial data was attempted.  

More information about the variables used in this analysis can be found in the "features_info.txt" file at the website linked to above.

VARIABLES

The raw data for this data set was collected from 30 people.  The "subject" variable identifies each test subject with a number from 1 to 30.  

The raw data was collected while participants engaged in six distinct activites:

	WALKING
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
        SITTING
	STANDING
        LAYING

The "activity" column of the tidy data set identifies which activity the subject was performing.
  
86 observation variables included in this data set are:
